# Clock-In-Out
This program allows for employees to clock in and out, and see how much they earned in the hours they worked before taxes. It also allows the owner to see how much they need to pay each employee. The scheduling function and time card function is not available as of yet, and the roster options are on a separate repository. I was having difficulty getting them to work together.
